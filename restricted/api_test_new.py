COMPATIBILITY FILE - ORIGINAL api_test.py HAS BEEN REFACTORED

This file has been refactored into multiple modules for better organization:

NEW STRUCTURE:
- api_scraping/base_scraper.py - Browser automation and API requests
- api_scraping/company_filter.py - Company exclusion logic
- api_scraping/data_processor.py - CSV handling and data processing
- api_scraping/messaging.py - Chat and messaging functionality
- api_scraping/main_scraper.py - Main orchestrator class
- sbc_scraper.py - New entry point

USAGE:
Instead of running this file, use the new entry point:
    python sbc_scraper.py

Or import the refactored components:
    from api_scraping import SBCAttendeesScraper
    scraper = SBCAttendeesScraper()
